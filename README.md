# neighborhood-map
Udacity Project 5 - A single-page application featuring a map of my 
neighborhood. Local Castles and Eateries that I like are listed and 
marked on the Google Map. Selecting a marker (either directly or 
via the left-hand bar) queries Flickr for photos based on the geo 
location of the marker.

# Getting started
1) Start a local http server, perhaps using one of the following:
    * python3 -m http.server 8080       (if using Python 3)
    * python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080   (if using Python 2)
2) Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in a browser

# How it works
1) When index.html is opened in a browser, the Javascript libraries are downloaded (from a CDN, except for the 
main application which is local) during HTML parsing
2) The Google Map API is called with a callback to the gmapViewModel, which initialises..
    1) the placeListViewModel (and applies the Knockout Bindings)
    2) the Google Map

# Features
* Responsive design achieved through Bootstrap Grid system
* Data binding of both Search Text and Places List through Knockout Observables
* The sidebar can be hidden by clicking the hamburger icon, allowing the map to fill all available space
* Typing in search box automatically filters list of places and map markers, resizing map as required
* Clicking a place on sidebar automatically selects place on map and opens Infowindow
* Selecting a marker displays the respective Infowindow and centers the map
* Clicking a marker on the map which has an open Infowindow will close the Infowindow
* Map is customized to make places stand out
* Map uses customized icons for places
* Flickr API used to retrieve relevant photos for marker's geo location and name
* Timeouts retrieving photo URLs from Flickr are handled gracefully
